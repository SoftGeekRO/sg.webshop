Founded in 2017, our company began as a dedicated software development firm with a passion for building efficient, scalable, and innovative digital solutions.
Over time, our curiosity, technical expertise, and drive to solve real-world problems led us to expand far beyond software alone.
Today, we proudly operate four specialized webstores under the SoftGeek umbrella:<br>

From code to cables, and solar to sensors, we’ve evolved into a multi-domain company with deep roots in both digital and physical tech. Whether you're automating your home, upgrading your solar setup, or managing your vehicle fleet, our goal remains the same: to empower curious minds and professionals with quality products, helpful content, and trustworthy support.
